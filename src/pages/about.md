## My Story

It started with a decision to change everything and the resilience to keep going when it didn't go to plan.

In 2022, I walked away from **medical school** in Burma to chase a different kind of precision. My initial path was blocked: I applied to the US and faced **three consecutive visa rejections**.

Most would have stopped there. I didn't.

In 2023, I redirected to the UK with a blank slate, starting my journey with nothing but CS50 and a relentless drive to catch up. That risk paid off. In just two years, I went from writing my first lines of code to engineering solutions as an **Amazon SDE Intern**, becoming an **MLH Fellow**, and winning **3 hackathons**.

Today, I'm not just catching up; I'm pushing the edge—building Zero Knowledge Proof solutions and autonomous robotics while finishing my degree at **Coventry University**.

I traded a stethoscope for a keyboard, but the goal remains the same: to solve complex problems that matter.

## Past Experience

### MLH Fellowship

**Midnight | Oct 2025 – Dec 2025**

I moved houses three times in 2025. Every single time, I faced the same awkward privacy nightmare: to secure a monthly payment plan, I either had to pay a year's rent upfront or ask friends to share their payslips, exposing their sensitive financial data to total strangers. **I hated it.**

That frustration drove me to build a prototype at the Midnight x MLH Hackathon. After being selected as a winner, I was invited to the Fellowship to build out the full product landscape. I spent three months engineering the **off-chain proof generation workflow** and a **custodial wallet system**, transforming a personal annoyance into a scalable, trustless tool.

I am incredibly grateful to the Midnight team for seeing the potential in my hackathon project and giving me the resources to build it. Thank you for teaching me that **privacy isn't just a feature; it's a right.**

### SDE Intern

**Amazon, Cambridge | April 2025 – July 2025**

There is 'coding,' and then there is **'engineering at Amazon scale.'**

During my internship, I worked on the nervous system of the cloud: **S3 Event Notifications**. The stakes were high. We were dealing with sudden traffic surges where a single bottleneck wouldn't just slow things down; it could cascade into a critical failure affecting thousands of users.

My mission was to minimize this **'blast radius.'** I designed and implemented a partitioning feature for internal SQS queues to isolate critical event types, ensuring that one "noisy neighbor" couldn't bring down the whole neighborhood.

I am incredibly grateful to my team for trusting an intern with such critical infrastructure. You taught me that writing the code is actually the easiest part. The real engineering happens before that, in **designing the architecture**, debating the **trade-offs**, and ensuring every line written is clean and maintainable for the future.
